# HealthCare
Multiple medical solutions just one click away.

This is an android app built by me and my teammates at an hackathon. It lets you chat with your doctor and get instant advice on things like your lab reports for the tests that you might have went through recently, or any other kind of regular checkup that you feel can be done online. It also spares you from all the hassle of keeping track of all your previous patient history.
